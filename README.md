# Social Media and Mental Health Analysis

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive analysis exploring the relationships between social media usage, demographics, and mental health. The project aims to uncover patterns and correlations within the data to better understand how social media impacts individuals' mental health, considering factors such as self-esteem, anxiety, and depression.

## Project Description

Our analysis delves into a diverse dataset encompassing multiple social media platforms and people's feelings. Leveraging advanced techniques such as data preprocessing, correlation assessments and statistical analysis, we aim to extract valuable insights and predict possible mental issues

## Research question

How does the use of social media affect individuals' mental health, including factors such as self-esteem, anxiety, and depression?

### Key Features

- **Correlation Analysis**: Explore and quantify relationships between variables, uncovering connections between social media habits, demographics, and mental health indicators.
- **Statistical Significance**: Assess the reliability of observed relationships, ensuring that correlations are not mere chance occurrences but have statistical meaning with a significance level set at alpha = 0.05.
- **Logistic Regression Model**: Employ a statistical model to analyze and predict the impact of various factors on categorical outcomes, aiding in understanding the influence of social media and demographics on mental health indicators.

## Dataset

We used a comprehensive dataset collected from a research project for the Statistics Course STA-2101 for the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB). Submitted by - Khan Raqib Mahmud. Submitted by - Souvik Ahmed (203014004) and Muhesena Nasiha Syeda (203014015).
